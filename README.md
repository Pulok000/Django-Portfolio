This was my first web app  project which was completed back in January 2019.I was learning Django framework and created a simple portfolio site.The main focus was to

- Create a simple web app
- Use API to collect random jokes
- Take user responses such as messages and basic personal Data
- Generate custom jokes using user's data
- Host the site live on Heroku
